# LSTM-for-Stock-Data

The pdf consists for the best performance of the data in which I have applied a Reinforcement Learning algorithm Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for one chunk of my data. The code had to be run multiple times for different tasks due to which the original results for this set has lost and thankfully I have captured the original in a pdf before executing the code again.  

The dataset is large and available in multiple chunks due to which I haven't uploaded completely yet and consists of multiple pre-processsing python files.
